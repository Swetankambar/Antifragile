This repo contains my review of chapters of nnt's book Antifragile

I capture my agreements and disagreements in this document. 


A  note on cherry-picking: 
Not all example selection are same. Basic flow of example selection that should be followed is the following: 
If a point has to be invalidated, an example supporting an invalidation would do.
It should be okay to use an example to show a characteristic's absence from a class
However, if a point  has to be made, an example supporting that validation will lead to error due to cherry-picking. 

I will highlight such errors present in the book, if any by using keyworkd Cherry-pick.
