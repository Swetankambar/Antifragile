Book2: Moderinty and the denial of antifragility.

Chapter 5: The souk and the office building.

Section: Two types of profession.

Cherry-pick: The seciton explores the differences between 2 types of professions, one of that of an artesian like a plumber, carpenter, auto-rickshaw driver, prostiture, painter etc. The example is set in London.
This section explores the freedom in when to work what to work on and whom to work for, job security in case a black swan event happens like the banking financial crisis. The cherry-picked example belongs to a developed nation (London) where the auto-driver in discussion has following economic advantages:
    1. The auto-driver is shown to on an average earn the same amount of money as the banker. This is currently not true at all in a country like India. Here we see that the aforementioned jobs of the artesian class does not offer people enough money to save for a decent eduaction, hospital expenses, marraige ceremonry of child, any vacation in India (going of of India is a dream they do not even think of). The banker on a per week basis, and on an average earn s much more than an auto rickshaw driver. This holds for employees of the banks like SBI or HDFC Bank who do menial jobs of portfolio management as well. If I compare someone who works for stragety or risk in banks like Morgan Stanley or Goldmansachs the difference is of a 20 folds in a year!!
    2. The auto-driver is shown to have freedome of choice in who to work for, which seems to be a situation true even in India, but it is not necessarily a condition that brings any good. Take for example alcoholics or drug addicts who do not want to do any work and just spend time idling at house. This does not improve the prosperity of the family or anything else for that matter. 
    3a. It is said that if there is a recession in the bank sector, after 25 years of work the banker has a high likelihood of not being able to find any employment. However, this seems far from what I see here. I met a cab driver who used to be a low rank engineer before 2008 crisis but when lost job, started driving cabs. How big can a city be in the age of google maps and smartphones to lean and drive anyway?
    3b. The vice-versa might not be true however, for example there were potters in India who become jobless once the industries started making pots.The rickshaw pullers are jobless since the auto-rickshaw, Uber and Ola boomed.
    4. Another thing not taken into account is the peer group. A corporate employee like an engineer has a group of peers who can help in improving the mental model of the world, becoming better prepared for future, even help in starting up an eterprise of his own. The same is not true however for a carpenter or a auto-rickshaw driver or a cab driver

In my understanding the point that has been made by the author in this section should be generalised as follows :
    One should try to maximize the self-reliance and freedom under the limits of oneself. Following rank holds in india when comparing the same:
    Cab-Driver and like < Bank PO/manager < Govt Staff < SW Engineer in a corporation < Niche Engineer professionals in Corporations < Freelance Skilled workers who can use internet for employment < Start-up owners 
Take a case of the ongoing coronavirus epidemic and the lockdown of the cities in India, there are no cabs on the road, no passengers on the road. No one is constructing houses and so on. On the other hand, if someone is working for a corporate, currently there are no salary reduction. At worst there will be lay-offs if the economy goes into recession. But then who will be there to spend money for the artisians to get a job?

Next, the author extrapolates the arguments of this section to compare centralized social or economic structure vs a decentralized structure. Under the light of the above arguments, I think unity has advantages to trigger and catalyze growth. More options is an illusion that may not be reliasable in a not prosperous society. Industrialization was a centralization effort that lead to development of large corporations. It also provided employment opportunities to the daily wage workers whose children later comprise the artesians of the London today.

Think about the thousands of farmers in India who strive for farming every year and still are unable to earn even enough to feed their own families during an year of low rainfall. However, the centralized efforts of government prevent them from dying, central subsidy makes them survive. Those years when the central government is unable to provide relief we see mass suicides. Stress does not bring any good here.
Furthermore, the central efforst of the enterprises enable these farmers to provide food to all other cities and states. Central transportation enables them to sell food across borders in the coutry.

Centralization may not be bad altogether, but an evaluation must be made case by case. Excess of anything is bad as the author noted earlier in the text.


Leaving the portion of the chapter that deals with black swan discussion. The problem is largely true.
