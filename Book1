Chapter 1
Between Damocles and Hydra

Fragility is the property of a substance which causes it to degrade from its current state when a stress is applied. 
When one thinks about the opposite of fragility, the word that one tends to use is robust, which is however not the true opposite of fragility as an opposite nature of a fragile substance will be to become stronger or improve from the current state with application of stress. Unfortunately we do not have a word in most languages that can convey this meaning. 
Hence nnt coined this term Antifragile, the property conveying the exact same as above. If a substance is fragile, it will either improve, or at worst ccase be unharmed with application of an external stress.
Altough there is no name in our traditional texts for such a property, it is ubuquitous in nature. Anything that is living is antifragile. 

Catch--> Beware about the curse of linearity. Meaning, stress will help anything antifragile upto a limit. This does not invalidate or discard the property though. 

Note --> It is pertinent to note that detection of antifragility is easier said than done. We humans are largely incapable of translating such notions across domains.  For example, a doctor who recommends exercise to get tougher also gives antibiotics for small flu treatment and thus makes the person more fragile. 

The author has expressed his disdain towards bankers and sometime goes out of bound to make his points. For example, page 39 mentions that a banker who is seen using a porter service to carry his luggage, however he goes to gym later to lift weight for fitness. I find this example more like humour with no relevance to the discussion.
