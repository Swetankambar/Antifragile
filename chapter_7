This chapter brings an amazing, amuzing and important concept of iatrogenic loss. Harm caused from healer. 

1. If there are professions whose aim is to survive on a problem's existence, such profession will never eradicate the problem. This is one of the menifestations of the principal agent problem. For example, if one visits to say 5 dentists (I did myself way before reading this in this book) he should be ready to see 5 different types of analysis. Same goes for asking a book edit from an editor. They keep on editing the edited stuff. This "naive interventionism" causes iatrogenic loss.
2. This is seen in multiple scenarios, from an overly protective mother who makes his child incapable of taking risks and decisison and becoming a sucker to a friend who tries to exercise over control in the life of another friend and leaves him in a unknown bad state of over dependency. 
3. In my view anything in excess is bad, and taleb makes his case in this direction. We should evaluate the harm that might be caused due to meddling with something that was existing in nature for a long time. 

Taleb's examples here are to show that iatrogenic harm is possible due to incorrect consideration or underamplification or not giving enough thought onthe treatment's possible harm. 
If something that seems to fix problems now causes much much bigger problems later, it is not a good method to solve the problem. When we see experts recommending something we tend to take it for granter and this can cause personal harm. There is a little in my opinion that can be done against it in many cases like medical science at a personal level. One has to heed a doctor. But when one is in a positino to formulate policy or take any action that is related to others, one must beware of the possible catastrophy. 
It is better to do no harm than do something that is going to worsen things. First do no harm.

A general approach that works well to provide insurance against iatrogenic loss is to respect systems that have been working since ages. But this isa highly impractical world view when one can't control everything around him. For example, taleb had a twitter post that promotes meat eating as we are practising tha from ages.
We must evaluate at any given time whether something that we are doing now is good or bad. With respect to meat eating, the high industrialisation of meat eating has changed the way we consume meat in terms of quality and quantity both as compared to our ancestors. Moreover,we must understand that selectively keeping meat eating at same level as before (quantity of intake, with a higher frequency) a fool's illusion of keeping things unchanged, moreover the lifestyle we lead should be coherent with the food that we eat. For someone having largely lethargic lifestyle meat eating does not make same sense as to someone doing a lot of physical labour.

Taleb says that a theory can be a very dangerous thing to have. This is apt and applies to the theories presented in this book as well. I must take all of them with a pinch of salt. Best advise is to not be a sucker. See for myself what works in the constraint I live in and reject other things.
[amiss] Again, it is essential to metion that theory is a dangerous thing to have, but a theory in itself is incomplete. A true scientific experiment should incorporate theory(hypothesis)->observation->results->feedback->hypothesis cycle. This method must be applied to solve any problem, from how to cook food to how to be a better friend to how to read and write a review.

******************************In praise of procastrination- the fabian kind****************************************
Fabain : Emplying dilatory, cautionary strategy to wear out an enemy. 
The central argument of this section is that one must not take big decisions which can cause bigger harms than benefits. One way to approach this is to delay taking an action if it is an intense action, 
--> Think of Mahabharat and the big oaths taken by Bhisma and it's implications
--> Plan well before you take a big action.
If possible, leave things on it's own and there is a good chance that it will heal itself. There are natural mechanisms present in most systems to prevent any fatal damage if left to heal on it's own

Another perspective that author brings is to reduce the amount of decisions we take or to reduce the processing load, one idea is to let all things pass. Instead of trying to catch everyting, let procastination be a filter. This holds true for love marraiges, jobs, fitness fads, fashion, shopping trende. Time is a good filter available for us to save from fragility.

Taleb goes overboard on page 123 where he mentions that a back pain of his got treated on its own when he went for a trek vacation, This he uses against modern medicine. This should be exercised with caution and the way to not be a sucker is to know when to stop, make changes in the method (go to a doctor if the pain persists more than a cettain no of days etc). 
Not a good idea to try this for say treating a hearing disorder or eye disorder. 

******************************************************************************************************************************************************
Naturalistic fallacy may be used as a wrong tool to prove certain cases. In most cases we are naturalistic and things around us are naturalistic. 
In my opinion one must see if there are layered arguments hidden under the name of naturalistic fallacy.

Neuroticism in industrial proportinos
This section highlight the idea that too much information is a bad thing, which is apt. Idea is interpolated from different fields like how news channels make us overthink unnecessary dangers, or how economic newpapers make us over worry about things. 
[wrong argument]: Taleb tries to make a right point but goes technically wrong while comparing SNR if someone reads paper daily vs once a year. He states if once a year is read, if SNR is 50-50, changing to daily will make it 5-95 
Fallacy is that noise does not remail constant. There will be smoothning of noise for sure, but there will be smoothning of signal as well. Observing a signal at a suitable RBW is the key. However, we can ignore this error and not be a sucker. More important idea is to not be overanxsious due to the over flooding media.
However it is funny that taleb himself is on twitter all time, posting all time these days. Thus reducing his SNR

The state can help- when incompetent

[cherry-pick] This section argues against states trying hard to control some situations, with some example of chinese femine of 1959 in context. With coronavirus I see that chinese intervention has worked amazingly well and so with India. USA, Europe has much larger death no. as of 21st April 202 as compared to India and China has brought the epidemic in control much better than countries in west. 
IMO, it is macro context dependent analysis which should be avoided. 

[Fun fact] In US every calorie of food requires 12 calorie for transportation. 
[cherry-pick][halo][conformation bias] :
Sweden has been potrayed as an efficient bottom-up non beurocratic society which has the property of no centralization making it a safe heaven. Coronavirus epidemic has shown otherway around in terms of people's death. ~1600 people have dies till 21s April. This is for sure lower than rest of europe but way more than china or india considering population density and total population and infrastructure availability.
