This chapter brings an amazing, amuzing and important concept of iatrogenic loss. Harm caused from healer. 

1. If there are professions whose aim is to survive on a problem's existence, such profession will never eradicate the problem. This is one of the menifestations of the principal agent problem. For example, if one visits to say 5 dentists (I did myself way before reading this in this book) he should be ready to see 5 different types of analysis. Same goes for asking a book edit from an editor. They keep on editing the edited stuff. This "naive interventionism" causes iatrogenic loss.
2. This is seen in multiple scenarios, from an overly protective mother who makes his child incapable of taking risks and decisison and becoming a sucker to a friend who tries to exercise over control in the life of another friend and leaves him in a unknown bad state of over dependency. 
3. In my view anything in excess is bad, and taleb makes his case in this direction. We should evaluate the harm that might be caused due to meddling with something that was existing in nature for a long time. 

Taleb's examples here are to show that iatrogenic harm is possible due to incorrect consideration or underamplification or not giving enough thought onthe treatment's possible harm. 
If something that seems to fix problems now causes much much bigger problems later, it is not a good method to solve the problem. When we see experts recommending something we tend to take it for granter and this can cause personal harm. There is a little in my opinion that can be done against it in many cases like medical science at a personal level. One has to heed a doctor. But when one is in a positino to formulate policy or take any action that is related to others, one must beware of the possible catastrophy. 
It is better to do no harm than do something that is going to worsen things. First do no harm.

A general approach that works well to provide insurance against iatrogenic loss is to respect systems that have been working since ages. But this isa highly impractical world view when one can't control everything around him. For example, taleb had a twitter post that promotes meat eating as we are practising tha from ages.
We must evaluate at any given time whether something that we are doing now is good or bad. With respect to meat eating, the high industrialisation of meat eating has changed the way we consume meat in terms of quality and quantity both as compared to our ancestors. Moreover,we must understand that selectively keeping meat eating at same level as before (quantity of intake, with a higher frequency) a fool's illusion of keeping things unchanged, moreover the lifestyle we lead should be coherent with the food that we eat. For someone having largely lethargic lifestyle meat eating does not make same sense as to someone doing a lot of physical labour.

Taleb says that a theory can be a very dangerous thing to have. This is apt and applies to the theories presented in this book as well. I must take all of them with a pinch of salt. Best advise is to not be a sucker. See for myself what works in the constraint I live in and reject other things.
[amiss] Again, it is essential to metion that theory is a dangerous thing to have, but a theory in itself is incomplete. A true scientific experiment should incorporate theory(hypothesis)->observation->results->feedback->hypothesis cycle. This method must be applied to solve any problem, from how to cook food to how to be a better friend to how to read and write a review.

******************************In praise of procastrination- the fabian kind****************************************
Fabain : Emplying dilatory, cautionary strategy to wear out an enemy. 
The central argument of this section is that one must not take big decisions which can cause bigger harms than benefits. One way to approach this is to delay taking an action if it is an intense action, 
--> Think of Mahabharat and the big oaths taken by Bhisma and it's implications
--> Plan well before you take a big action.
If possible, leave things on it's own and there is a good chance that it will heal itself. There are natural mechanisms present in most systems to prevent any fatal damage if left to heal on it's own

Another perspective that author brings is to reduce the amount of decisions we take or to reduce the processing load, one idea is to let all things pass. Instead of trying to catch everyting, let procastination be a filter. This holds true for love marraiges, jobs, fitness fads, fashion, shopping trende. Time is a good filter available for us to save from fragility.
